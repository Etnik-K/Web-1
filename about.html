                    <li><a href="./home.html"><b>Meso.com</b></a> is a Web Platform that intends to help the youth during their learning journey.</li>
                    <li>We try to be different from other platforms by making the process of learning school subjects fun.</li>
                    <li>We do that by engaging our customers with fun activities that make them more interested in learning and more excited about it.</li>
                    <li>At <a href="./home.html"><b>Meso.com</b></a>, learning is like a game where you have fun and feel included and validated while at the same time studying, which helps you get further in life.</li>
